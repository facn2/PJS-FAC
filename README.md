# PJS-FAC
An application which searches for Giphs and plays them on TV screen.

## **What**

### User Stories
As a  person loves special stuff I want to:

+ search for something and watch a Giphy about it .
+ enjoy watching Giphys in a special way.

### Stretch Goals
+ enable general information about the things we search for.
+ make it look beautiful with CSS.
+ creating tests.



## **How**

This is how we will split up the tasks to complete the Giphy app - 
We did a team job and worked in one computer for writing the code ;and in two computers for styling that each one of us can add his changes to the style. 

### Part 1

+ Create new repository with readme.
+ As a group read through the project purpose and try our best to understand the code.
+ Creating API's from the Guardian and Giphy.
+ ensure all members of the team understand the code

### Part 2

+ Create the app using pure functions in the handler.js 

### Rules

+ camelCase for class names and variable.
+ always team job and explains your changes.
